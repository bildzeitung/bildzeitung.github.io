<p>I generally don&rsquo;t do a lot of care and feeding here, as I&rsquo;m mostly on one machine these days, but it&rsquo;s still useful to do a push every once in a while. In this case, the motivators are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the submodules haven&rsquo;t been updated in a while</li>
<li>I was getting submodule errors for the solarized colour scheme, and that was annoying</li>
<li>I was working at a Starbucks and the Macbook monitor is a little too small (for the font size I use) to run side-by-side windows for coding</li>
</ul>

<p>So I went in search for ways to run Python nosetest from vim. I&rsquo;m giving <a href="https://github.com/JarrodCTaylor/vim-python-test-runner.git">this module</a> a go, and will see how it works. It plops the test results into a quick fix window. While it seems silly not to use PyCharm, I simply haven&rsquo;t had a chance to get used to it, or get fast at it &ndash; right now, I feel like it slows me down. Also, since it&rsquo;s an IDE, I also find I have to take my hands off the keyboard &ndash; a goal I get closer to in vim already. But, that&rsquo;s also because I haven&rsquo;t spent the time to learn the keyboard shortcuts in the IDE &ndash; a vicious cycle.</p>
