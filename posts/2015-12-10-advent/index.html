<p>The clever thing to do is to implement what amounts to a fancy state diagram of repeating sequences &ndash; an effort that is, sadly, too time consuming for this exercise. That such a thing exists, however, is entirely fascinating, and my respect for John Conway, already very high for many years, continues to increase.</p>
