      Another RPG problem today, except this time it is a simulation.
I treated this as a game simulation, so I did a breadth-first search along objects representing the game state, with the player choices for the child nodes. There are plenty of pruning conditions, including using found solutions as upper bounds on the problem space. The pruning makes a full brute-force search feasible.

      Today&rsquo;s problem looks like a simulation, but can be fairly easily math&rsquo;d.
In this case, the idea is to load the data and run an exhaustive search of potential player loadouts, calculating the number of turns it would take the player to kill the boss, compared to the number of turns it would take for the boss to kill the player. Then, save all of the costs associated with player wins and output the smallest.

The infinite houses business comes up often enough in undergrad math courses that it&rsquo;s not unfamiliar, but having to solve for it, or sieve for a solution, is still something that takes doing.

      Today&rsquo;s puzzle displays the largest difficulty gap so far, as the first part is an easy regex-based enumeration and the second is a parser / derivation puzzle based on the same input data.
I began by assuming that the language being represented was parsable by a basic bottom-up parser &ndash; no lookahead or anything else. It turns out that, without analysis, my assumption was reasonable and the solution works just fine.

      This problem was about quickly deriving a formula, and then using it a couple different ways.
The distance a reindeer fly can be calculated for an arbitrary time, so writing the function that way makes the first part trivial. You don&rsquo;t even need to know the reindeer&rsquo;s name &ndash; only the flight characteristics.
For the second part, it&rsquo;s a piecewise calculation for each second, since a winner needs to be found after each second.

      There are a couple of different approaches to today&rsquo;s problem; one being brute force, and the other a sophisticated state machine.
I chose to do manual sequence generation, which on the second part took a while. I started off using a regex for this, but that proved far too slow, so I walked the string manually after that.
The clever thing to do is to implement what amounts to a fancy state diagram of repeating sequences &ndash; an effort that is, sadly, too time consuming for this exercise.

      The Day 3 puzzle presents as overly complicated, given a two-dimensional space, but is an encoding and memoization problem solvable in O(n) with respect to the input.
My solution is significantly less elegant than the best Python is saw for this. I keep forgetting that a case statement is more or less a lookup table, which is doable with a dictionary.

      The Day 2 puzzle is a remember-the-property puzzle &ndash; some simple geometry with the minor twist that instead of checking a bunch of combinations of length, width, and height, all that&rsquo;s necessary is to sort the input values.
Sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to work with commutative operators.
It&rsquo;s basic math and some Python to sort through it all was sufficient.

      Advent of code is a fun programming challenge site running over Christmas. I&rsquo;m quite enjoying the problems so far, largely as warm-ups. Some of the posted solutions are also leagues better than mine, which is helpful.
Looks like the author and community are over on Reddit.

      The Day 1 puzzle is a parenthesis matching exercise, in a sense, but can be reduced down to a linear run through the input.
I managed to get the data for solving the first part of this challenge into a Unix one-liner:
{% highlight bash %} #!/bin/bash cat paren.in | perl -ne &lsquo;print join(&rdquo;\n&rdquo;,split //);&rsquo; | sort | uniq -c {% endhighlight %}
The code is here.

      You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve --watch, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.

      The fast.ai course claims to help develop some competence in Deep Learning, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a go.
The material is divided into several lessons, and the first one concerns itself with setting up an environment. The environment is geared towards using a VM from an IaaS provider. But, I have a fancy pants Windows box with a fancy pants graphics card.
Base software At a minimum, I need to source and the course materials * Installed Git For Windows (aka git-bash) * Cloned the repo into the fastai directory

      I&rsquo;m at Pycon 2018. It&rsquo;s been lovely; the keynotes, the dinners, the talks, the people &mdash; all of it.
The development sprints are a part of conference I am particularly interested in, and the organisers created a helpful workshop to help prepare folks.
Part of this is installing Anaconda as a way of driving virtual environments. It&rsquo;s a good plan, and even though Visual Studio Express installs one for you already, I decided to be strict about all this and download it from here, as directed.
