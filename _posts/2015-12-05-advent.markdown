[Advent of code][advent] is a fun programming challenge site running over Christmas. Discussion [over on Reddit][reddit].

For [Day 5][day], knowledge of what regexes can do is needed. While the languages presented are not regular, they are amenable to most extended regex implementations. Both parts of this problem were [entirely solvable via bash scripts][code], which makes my little Unix heart proud.
