[Day 15][day] is an optimisation problem, and it can be attacked as a constraints-based linear program.

I spent some cycles looking for linear programming packages, but bailed on it and went [brute-force][code] instead. To expedite the calculations, I used NumPy's vector and matrix methods. To generate the solution vectors, I used a generator that treated the problem as a sort of carry-under system.
