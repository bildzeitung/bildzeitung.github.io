[Advent of code][advent] is a fun programming challenge site running over Christmas. Discussion [over on Reddit][reddit].

The [Day 3][day] puzzle presents as overly complicated, given a two-dimensional space, but is an encoding and memoization problem solvable in O(n) with respect to the input.

My [solution][code] is significantly less elegant than the best Python is saw for this. I keep forgetting that a case statement is more or less a lookup table, which is doable with a dictionary.
