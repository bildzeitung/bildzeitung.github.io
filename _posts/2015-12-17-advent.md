I can't really remember if [Day 17][day] is a knapsack problem or a sub-set sum problem.

Either way, a smart exhaustive search [does the trick][code]. Essentially, I ordered the containers and treated the solution space as a head-tail problem (take the head, analyse the tail), and prune solution subtrees based on that. The code is short, elegant, and gets to the right answers quickly enough.
