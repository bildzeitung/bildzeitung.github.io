[Advent of code][advent] is a fun programming challenge site running over Christmas. Discussion [over on Reddit][reddit].

Parsing the input data is getting a bit easier, and this uses tricks from prior problems. For example, this problem also involves building up a matrix, as was the TSP problem.

For this one, I got to polish up a bunch of the *itertools* tricks I'd seen employed in the TSP and other problems, so the solution (brute force though it is) looks quite elegant.
