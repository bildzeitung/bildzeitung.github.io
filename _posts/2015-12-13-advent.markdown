[Seating problems][day] are pretty classic, and this again involves iterating through a bunch of permutations. 

Parsing the input data is getting a bit easier, and this uses tricks from prior problems. For example, this problem also involves building up a matrix, as was the TSP problem.

For this one, I got to polish up a bunch of the *itertools* tricks I'd seen employed in the TSP and other problems, so [the solution][code] (brute force though it is) looks quite elegant.
