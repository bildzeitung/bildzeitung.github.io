[Advent of code][advent] is a fun programming challenge site running over Christmas. Discussion [over on Reddit][reddit].

The trick with this one is to think carefully about what is actually being calculated. Many folks sorted this out by running the strings through an *eval* of some kind. I'm not that clever, so I sorted it out with a Perl 1-liner using a sequence of string substitutions. [Both parts][code] were amenable to this treatment.
