I think the trick with the [Day 8 puzzle][day] is to think carefully about what is actually being calculated.

Many folks sorted this out by running the strings through an *eval* of some kind. I'm not that clever, so I sorted it out with a Perl 1-liner using a sequence of string substitutions. [Both parts][code] were amenable to this treatment.
