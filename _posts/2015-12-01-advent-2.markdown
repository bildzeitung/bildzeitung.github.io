[Advent of code][advent] is a fun programming challenge site running over Christmas. Discussion [over on Reddit][reddit].

The [Day 1][day] puzzle is a parenthesis matching exercise, in a sense, but can be reduced down to a linear run through the input. In fact, I managed to get the data for solving the first part of this challenge into a Unix one-liner:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
cat paren.in | perl -ne 'print join("\n",split //);' | sort | uniq -c
{% endhighlight %}

The [code is here][code].
