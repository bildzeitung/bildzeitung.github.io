[Virtual machines][day] are a bit of specialty of mine.

At least, the code to run them is. This was my best showing -- 35th on the leader board -- and I suspect that if I typed faster and ran the code a little less that I'd have done better. But, I'm slow and plod and all that. This problem was straightforward -- implement a VM tuned to solving the Collatz Conjecture. Normally, this sort of insanity is best done in C, but Python was fast enough for the problem at hand.
