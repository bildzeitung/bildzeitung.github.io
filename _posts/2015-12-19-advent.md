[Today's puzzle][day] displays the largest difficulty gap so far, as the first part is an easy regex-based enumeration and the second is a parser / derivation puzzle based on the same input data.

I began by assuming that the language being represented was parsable by a basic bottom-up parser -- no lookahead or anything else. It turns out that, without analysis, my assumption was reasonable and the solution [works just fine][code].
