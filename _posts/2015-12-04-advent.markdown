[Advent of code][advent] is a fun programming challenge site running over Christmas. Discussion [over on Reddit][reddit].

The [Day 4][day] puzzle is definitely a mining exercise, which made me think that a C solution would be the best place to start, but it turns out that you don't have to mine all that hard, so the [Python solution][code] was fast enough. I would argue that this is a straight ahead read the spec and use the appropriate library problem, with space for those who want to cram in some basic multiprocessing.
