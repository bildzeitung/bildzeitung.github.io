The [Day 4][day] puzzle is definitely a mining exercise, which made me think that a C solution would be the best place to start.

It turns out that you don't have to mine all that hard, though, so the [Python solution][code] was fast enough. I would argue that this is a straight ahead read the spec and use the appropriate library problem, with space for those who want to cram in some basic multiprocessing.
