[Today's problem][day] looks like a simulation, but can be fairly easily math'd.

In this case, the idea is to load the data and run an exhaustive search of potential player loadouts, calculating the number of turns it would take the player to kill the boss, compared to the number of turns it would take for the boss to kill the player. Then, save all of the costs associated with player wins and output the smallest. Easy peasy.
