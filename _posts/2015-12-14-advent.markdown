[This problem][day] was about quickly deriving a formula, and then using it a couple different ways.

The distance a reindeer fly can be calculated for an arbitrary time, so writing the function that way makes the first part trivial. You don't even need to know the reindeer's name -- only the flight characteristics.

For the second part, it's a piecewise calculation for each second, since a winner needs to be found after each second. In other words, this is a full simulation of the race.

In theory, part 1 could also be a full simulation, too, which would lower the churn on part 2, but I didn't think of it that way.

Again, using Python list comprehensions and other tricks makes the [solution][code] look pretty clean.
