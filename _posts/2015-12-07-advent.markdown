[Advent of code][advent] is a fun programming challenge site running over Christmas. Discussion [over on Reddit][reddit].

There are lots of clever ways to approach [Day 7][day] -- a logic language (Prolog), a functional language that will just resolve the whole circuit by definition -- that sort of thing. Since I'm currently a Python programmer, and this is a warm-up for the day, I opted for the brute force solution of passing over the data until every wire is resolved.

At least I didn't miss at the solution this time. 

Solution [here][code].
