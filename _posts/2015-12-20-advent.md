There are a couple approaches to [today's problem][day], including some math ones. I missed most of the math, though.

The infinite houses business comes up often enough in undergrad math courses that it's not unfamiliar, but having to solve for it, or sieve for a solution, is still something that takes doing. [What I ended up][code] with was a solution that tries to start from a reasonable place, so as to cut down the search space some.
