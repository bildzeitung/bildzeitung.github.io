The [Day 2][day] puzzle is a remember-the-property puzzle -- some simple geometry with the minor twist that instead of checking a bunch of combinations of length, width, and height, all that's necessary is to sort the input values.

Sometimes it's nice to work with commutative operators.

It's basic math and [some Python][code] to sort through it all was sufficient.
