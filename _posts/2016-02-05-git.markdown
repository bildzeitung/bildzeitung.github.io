Time to update the [dot files][repo] repo.

I generally don't do a lot of care and feeding here, as I'm mostly on one machine these days, but it's still useful to do a push every once in a while. In this case, the motivators are:

* the submodules haven't been updated in a while
* I was getting submodule errors for the solarized colour scheme, and that was annoying
* I was working at a Starbucks and the Macbook monitor is a little too small (for the font size I use) to run side-by-side windows for coding

So I went in search for ways to run Python nosetest from vim. I'm giving [this module][nose] a go, and will see how it works. It plops the test results into a quick fix window. While it seems silly not to use PyCharm, I simply haven't had a chance to get used to it, or get fast at it -- right now, I feel like it slows me down. Also, since it's an IDE, I also find I have to take my hands off the keyboard -- a goal I get closer to in vim already. But, that's also because I haven't spent the time to learn the keyboard shortcuts in the IDE -- a vicious cycle.
