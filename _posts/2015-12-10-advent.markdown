There are a couple of different approaches to [today's problem][day]; one being brute force, and the other a sophisticated state machine.

I chose to do manual sequence generation, which on the second part took a while. I started off using a regex for this, but that proved far too slow, so I walked the string manually after that.

The clever thing to do is to implement what amounts to a fancy state diagram of repeating sequences -- an effort that is, sadly, too time consuming for this exercise. That such a thing exists, however, is entirely fascinating, and my respect for John Conway, already very high for many years, continues to increase.
