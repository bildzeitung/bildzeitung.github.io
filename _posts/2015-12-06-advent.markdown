[Day 6][day] presents another problem where knowing the right tool for the job turns out to be very helpful. In this case, it's [NumPy][numpy]. 

[NumPy][numpy]'s element-wise operations and subscripting (slicing and dicing!) made the job tractable, at least for me.

I confess, though, this is the first problem where I've whiffed on the answer. I only missed once (on each part), but my pride is stil wounded.

Solution [here][code].
