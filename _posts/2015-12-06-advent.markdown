[Advent of code][advent] is a fun programming challenge site running over Christmas. Discussion [over on Reddit][reddit].

[Day 6][day] presents another problem where knowing the right tool for the job turns out to be very helpful. In this case, it's [numpy][numpy], as its element-wise operations and subscripting (slicing and dicing!) made the job tractable.

I confess, though, this is the first problem where I've whiffed on the answer. I only missed once (on each part), so my pride is rather wounded.

Solution [here][code].
