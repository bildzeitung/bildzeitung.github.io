The [fast.ai][fastai] [course][course] claims to help develop some competence in Deep Learning, so I thought I'd give it a go.

The material is divided into several lessons, and the first one concerns itself
with setting up an environment. The environment is geared towards using a VM
from an IaaS provider. But, I have a fancy pants Windows box with a fancy pants
graphics card.

# Base software
At a minimum, I need to source and the course materials
* Installed [Git For Windows][gitbash] (aka git-bash)
* Cloned the [repo][repo] into the `fastai` directory

# Deep Learning software
Looking at the [video][lesson1-video], it appears that they use a script to 
setup the VM, [here][paperspace-setup]. I think it stands to reason that this
provides a fair summary of the minimum required software to get going, so I
will vaguely follow along with what it's trying to do.

Steps taken:
* Download & install [NVidia CUDA][cuda] -- base install, plus the 3x patches
* Download & install [Anaconda][anaconda]; also installed VS Code, since it had
  a link for it and all in the installer
* Performed a `cd fastai ; conda env update`, which downloaded a bunch more stuff, including some CUDA things

The env update seems to bring in a different version of Python, things like zeromq, eg. so it's a little much; not sure whether all of this is truly relevant. But, we'll see how it all goes.

In Windows, to get the env, it looks like it's `conda activate fastai` instead of a bash `source`. This seemed ok, so far; no apparent errors.

Then:
* Grabbed the data: `cd .. ; mkdir data ; cd data ; curl -O http://files.fast.ai/data/dogscats.zip`; this is 800M, compressed -- non-trivial download
* Unzipped the contents: `unzip -q dogscats.zip`; uncompressed size is 899M, or thereabouts
* The script symlinks the data directory into the course: `cd ..\fastai\courses\dl1 ; mklink -D .\data d:\projects\data`
* Initialise the notebook: `jupyter notebook --generate-config`
* The script installs *ipywidgets*, but it is already installed, so this is a nop
* It then double-checks that it is possible to use the JavaScript extensions: `jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix`

That should do it, in terms of initial setup. I haven't rebooted Windows, so I'm not clear if the CUDA bits are live / active at this point.

# Running the notebook
To run the notebook, I did: `cd ..\.. ; jupyter notebook`.

This opened a browser window and from there I selected the Lesson 1 notebook.

Debugging Lesson 1:
* The `import fastai.imports import *` fails immediately; looking at the source, it's a symlink, so create it: `mklink /d fastai ..\..\fastai`

Now the imports work (no restarts required; just re-run the block), and *torch* reports a working NVidia backend.

The initial run of the model downloads a bunch of model data, which was initially discouraging, as it seemed like there was a bunch of work being done and taking far longer than the demo on the video. I suspect that the install script installs these, via one of the downloads I *didn't* do, but since it auto-loads, it's not a showstopper and I don't have to look around for more bits and pieces.

The model run takes all of 6 seconds on my machine, which has an NVidia GTX 1081 Ti, with an accuracy of 99.267%; just super.
