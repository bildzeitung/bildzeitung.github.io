Another RPG problem [today][day], except this time it is a simulation.

I treated this as a game simulation, so I did a breadth-first search along objects representing the game state, with the player choices for the child nodes. There are plenty of pruning conditions, including using found solutions as upper bounds on the problem space. The pruning makes a full brute-force search feasible.
